## Overview

This is a repository is the project of the **Inventory Squad** for the NYU masters class **CSCI-GA.2820-001 DevOps and Agile Methodologies**. This project is a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) app contains one inventory of all of the products that an e-commerce web site sells. And keep track of the detailed information of the inventory items (id, name, quantity, condition etc.) with the [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) database model. Also, the app implements the management features like **Add**, **Get**, **Delete**, **Update** and **List** for items in the inventory database by using the RESTful API.

### Start cluster

```bash
make cluster
```

### Ways to launch the application

1. skaffold

   Run by using skaffold. The default port is 8080.

    ```bash
    skaffold dev
    ```

2. k3d

    Run by using k3d cluster. The default port is 8080.

    **Note: using this launch method should modify this config in the deployment.yaml**

    ```yaml
    - name: inventory
            # shuold use this instead of image:inventory
            image: cluster-registry:32000/inventory:1.0
            # image: inventory
            imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    ```

    Related commands:

    ```bash
    docker build -t inventory:1.0 .
    docker tag inventory:1.0 cluster-registry:32000/inventory:1.0
    docker push cluster-registry:32000/inventory:1.0
    kubectl apply -f k8s/
    ```

## Run flask

The Flask app now runs on the local machine. To start the app, type the following command in the shell:

```bash
make run
```

After the shell showing the message indicate the app is running successfully, you can access the homepage of the app and use RESTful API to interact with the app.

To access the home page of the app, you can go to <http://localhost:8000/>. This page will provide you some information about the app.

## RESTful API usage

### Create

To create a new item in the inventory, you can use the directory `/inventory` of the app with the method of `POST`.

### Get

To get an item with specified id, you can use the directory `/inventory/<iid>` of the app with the method of `GET`, where `<iid>` is the id of the item.

### Update

To update an item, you can use the directory `/inventory/<iid>` of the app with the method of `PUT`, where `<iid>` is the id of the item to be updated.

### Delete

To delete an item, you can use the directory `/inventory/<iid>` of the app with the method of `DELETE`, where `<iid>` is the id of the item to be delete.

### List

To list all the items in the inventory, you can use the directory `/inventory` of the app with the method of `GET`.

## Test

The development of the project follows TDD practices. The tests are in the directory `./tests`. Now, the test coverage is 96%. To run the tests, type the following command in the shell:

```bash
make test
```

And you will see the results of the tests.
